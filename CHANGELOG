Version 0.6.6 (beta) Changelog
==========
1. Fixed a bug when reading results by a unique identifier. For example:
	Book::read("1");
would not work, whereas
	Book::read(1);
would. The expression was previously parsed with is_int() but it now uses is_numeric(). 

2. Fixed issue where single elements to bind still had to be placed inside of an array. For example:
	Book::read("WHERE year=?", [1994]);
can now be written as:
	Book::read("WHERE year=?", 1994);

3. Changed the structure of the PormConfig and PormClass classes so that the database and table info is stored in the PormClass objects.  Each PormClass now has a $tableName and $dbName field as well as a getFullName() function which works just as the old one did.
For example:
	$name = PormConfig::getFullName($user);
is now written as:
	$name = $user::getFullName();
Similarly:
	$dbName = PormConfig::getDBShort($user);
becomes:
	$dbName = $user::dbName;
This change also removes the need to store class/table mappings in the PormConfig class. Also, the namespaces field has also become unnecesasry and has been removed.

4. Improved the way classes are genereated by the gen.php script. The db/table info is now included and the output is better formatted.

5. Added a test.php script which runs some really simple tests making sure that Morph can connect; create tables; and create, read, update, and delete rows. It cleans up after itself.
